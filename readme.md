Make sure python is installed and it's interpreter is selected in vscode.
On MacOs/Linux type "python3 -m venv .venv", this creates a virtual environment. Select yes in the pop-up to use the new virtual envirnoment.
Now open a new terminal to be in the virtual env folder. The activate command is probably loading the virtual env. "source "/Users/syedahsanaskari/Documents/AI/Python Practice/Virtual Env/.venv/bin/activate"".
Test it by trying to install a library using pip. Example "pip install discord".
Now that library can be imported in code.
